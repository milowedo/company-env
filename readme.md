# Employee info space
This is a project I created after completing a `Spring` course, in order to somehow sum up what I have learned.



## Introduction: What is it?

It is a `spring` web application. A platform where people can create/manage their own accounts.
 
 - Depending on whether you are an admin, you can be in power to delete/update all of existing accounts.

 - Password athentication and encryption is powered by `Spring Security`.

 - Data is stored in `MySQL` database with `Hibernate's` help.
